## 🔧 Troubleshooting

#### Recording on a parallel track induce a huge echo
- This is because the mic is recording while the speaker is playing the upper track at the same time.
The sound is travelling from speaker to mic through the air and thus introduce an echo (in fact caused by
processing time).
- I can't do much about it. **Lower the volume of your device
OR use headphones 🎧 with an integrated mic and you'll do just fine.**
